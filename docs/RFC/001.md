## ProjectOneMil aims to develop a scalable, high-performance web application using ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core. The project utilizes PostgreSQL for database management and incorporates various architectural decisions to handle large datasets efficiently

# Background

### ProjectOneMil was initiated to develop a high-performance, scalable web application capable of managing and processing large datasets efficiently. As the scope and data volume of the application grew, it became clear that the existing system could not keep up with the increasing demands for speed, scalability, and reliability

### The need for a new approach arose from several key challenges encountered with the previous system. These included difficulties in handling large volumes of data, performance bottlenecks, and limitations in scalability. The decision to undertake a major architectural revision was driven by the necessity to address these issues and to ensure the application could support future growth and evolving user needs

### This RFC outlines the architectural and technical decisions made to address these challenges, including the adoption of ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core for improved performance and scalability, and PostgreSQL for robust data management. The background section aims to provide sufficient context for understanding why these changes were necessary and how they contribute to the overall goals of the ProjectOneMil initiative

# Proposal

### To address the performance and scalability challenges outlined, ProjectOneMil proposes adopting ASP.NET Core MVC for its high-performance web framework, Entity Framework Core for efficient ORM capabilities, and PostgreSQL for robust database management. The solution includes using frontend technologies like jQuery, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for a responsive user interface, implementing ASP.NET Core Identity for secure authentication, and leveraging the EPPlus library for Excel file processing. This approach aims to provide a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly application capable of managing large datasets effectively

# Implementation

### The implementation of ProjectOneMil involves several critical components, including the integration of Entity Framework Core for data management and PostgreSQL as the database solution. The AppDbContext class is configured to use PostgreSQL through the Npgsql provider, as specified in the connection string retrieved from the application's configuration. This class manages the database context for the application and includes a DbSet<MyTable> for data operations related to the MyTable entity

### The OnModelCreating method is used to configure entity properties, with a specific example being the conversion of DateTime values to ensure they are handled as UTC dates. This is crucial for maintaining consistency across different time zones

### The implementation also includes the integration of various frontend technologies like jQuery, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. ASP.NET Core Identity will be utilized for secure authentication and authorization, while the EPPlus library will facilitate Excel file processing. These technologies collectively aim to enhance both the backend performance and the frontend user experience

    using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

    namespace ProjectOneMil.Data {

      public class AppDbContext: DbContext {

        public IConfiguration Configuration {
          get;
        }

        public AppDbContext(IConfiguration configuration)

        {

          Configuration = configuration;

        }

        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)

        {

          optionsBuilder.UseNpgsql(Configuration.GetConnectionString("WebApiDatabase"));

        }

        public DbSet < MyTable > onemildata {
          get;
          set;
        }

        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)

        {

          modelBuilder.Entity < MyTable > ().Property(e => e.Column4)

            .HasConversion(

              v => DateTime.SpecifyKind(v, DateTimeKind.Utc),

              v => DateTime.SpecifyKind(v, DateTimeKind.Utc)

            );

        }

      }

    }
# UI/UX

### The UI/UX improvements proposed for ProjectOneMil aim to significantly enhance the overall user experience. The user login and registration processes will be streamlined to provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface, making it easier for users to authenticate and create accounts. The MyTableController will be designed to offer a seamless experience for managing data, including functionalities for viewing, editing, and deleting records with minimal friction. Additionally, the management of roles and users will be optimized to ensure that both administrators and regular users can efficiently manage and edit roles and user profiles. These changes are intended to improve usability and overall user satisfaction by providing clear, accessible, and effective interfaces for all user interactions
