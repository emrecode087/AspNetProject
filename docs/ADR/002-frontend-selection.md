# ADR: 002 - Frontend Framework Selection for ProjectOneMil

## Context
The `ProjectOneMil` project requires a frontend framework to build a responsive and interactive user interface. The team has decided to use jQuery, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery DataTables with AJAX for the frontend development. The project is built using .NET 8.0 and integrates with Entity Framework Core and PostgreSQL.

## Decision
We have decided to use jQuery, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery DataTables with AJAX as the frontend technologies for the `ProjectOneMil` project.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **React**:
   - Pros:
     - Modern and widely used.
     - Component-based architecture.
   - Cons:
     - Steeper learning curve.
     - Requires additional setup and tooling.

2. **Angular**:
   - Pros:
     - Comprehensive framework with built-in features.
     - Strong community support.
   - Cons:
     - Steeper learning curve.
     - Heavier and more complex for small to medium-sized projects.

3. **Vue.js**:
   - Pros:
     - Easy to learn and integrate.
     - Flexible and lightweight.
   - Cons:
     - Smaller community compared to React and Angular.
     - Less mature ecosystem.

## Rationale
jQuery, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery DataTables with AJAX were chosen for the following reasons:
- **Familiarity**: The team is already familiar with these technologies, reducing the learning curve.
- **Simplicity**: These technologies are straightforward to use and integrate with existing .NET projects.
- **Responsiveness**: Bootstrap provides a responsive design framework, making it easier to create mobile-friendly interfaces.
- **Performance**: jQuery DataTables with AJAX can handle large datasets efficiently, providing fast data retrieval and display.
- **Legacy Support**: jQuery and JavaScript are well-supported and can be used to enhance existing codebases.

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Faster development due to familiarity with the technologies.
  - Easier integration with the existing .NET backend.
  - Responsive design capabilities with Bootstrap.
  - Efficient handling of large datasets with jQuery DataTables and AJAX.
- **Negative**:
  - Limited scalability and maintainability compared to modern frameworks like React or Angular.
  - Potential for more verbose and less modular code.

## Implementation
The following steps will be taken to implement jQuery, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery DataTables with AJAX in the `ProjectOneMil` project:
1. **Set Up Bootstrap**: Include Bootstrap via CDN or npm package.
2. **Include jQuery**: Add jQuery via CDN or npm package.
3. **Include jQuery DataTables**: Add jQuery DataTables via CDN or npm package.
4. **Develop UI Components**: Use jQuery and JavaScript to develop interactive UI components.
5. **Apply Styling**: Use Bootstrap classes to style the UI components and ensure responsiveness.
6. **Integrate with Backend**: Set up AJAX calls using jQuery to interact with the .NET backend and fetch large datasets efficiently.
