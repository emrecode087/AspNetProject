# ADR: 001 - Database Selection for ProjectOneMil

## Context
The `ProjectOneMil` project requires a robust and scalable database solution to store and manage user data and other application-related information. The project is built using .NET 8.0 and Entity Framework Core, and it needs to support complex queries, transactions, and data integrity.

## Decision
We have decided to use PostgreSQL as the database for the `ProjectOneMil` project.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **SQL Server**:
   - Pros:
     - Strong integration with .NET and Entity Framework Core.
     - Rich feature set and robust performance.
   - Cons:
     - Higher licensing costs for production environments.
     - Heavier resource requirements.

2. **MySQL**:
   - Pros:
     - Open-source and widely used.
     - Good performance for read-heavy workloads.
   - Cons:
     - Less mature .NET integration compared to SQL Server.
     - Potential issues with complex transactions and data integrity.

3. **SQLite**:
   - Pros:
     - Lightweight and easy to set up.
     - No server required.
   - Cons:
     - Not suitable for high-concurrency and large-scale applications.
     - Limited support for advanced database features.

## Rationale
PostgreSQL was chosen for the following reasons:
- **Open-Source**: PostgreSQL is open-source, which helps in reducing licensing costs.
- **Feature-Rich**: It offers a rich set of features, including support for complex queries, transactions, and data integrity.
- **Scalability**: PostgreSQL is highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data and high-concurrency workloads.
- **Community Support**: It has a strong community and extensive documentation, making it easier to find solutions and best practices.

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Reduced licensing costs due to the open-source nature of PostgreSQL.
  - Improved scalability and performance for the application.
  - Access to a wide range of features and strong community support.

- **Negative**:
  - Potential learning curve for team members unfamiliar with PostgreSQL.
  - Need to ensure proper configuration and optimization for best performance.

## Implementation
The following steps will be taken to implement PostgreSQL in the `ProjectOneMil` project:
1. **Install PostgreSQL**: Set up a PostgreSQL server for development and production environments.
2. **Update Connection Strings**: Modify the `appsettings.json` file to include the PostgreSQL connection string.
3. **Configure Entity Framework Core**: Update the Entity Framework Core configuration to use the `Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL` provider.
4. **Database Migrations**: Create and apply database migrations to set up the initial schema.
