# ADR: 006 - Efficient Data Display with jQuery DataTables and Server-Side Processing for ProjectOneMil

## Context
The `ProjectOneMil` project requires the ability to display a large dataset (one million records) efficiently in a web-based table. The goal is to ensure that the data is loaded and displayed in milliseconds to provide a seamless user experience. The team needs to decide on the approach and technologies to be used for this purpose.

## Decision
We have decided to use jQuery DataTables with AJAX and server-side processing to display the large dataset efficiently in the `ProjectOneMil` project.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Client-Side Processing**:
   - Pros:
     - Simpler implementation.
     - No need for server-side logic.
   - Cons:
     - Poor performance with large datasets.
     - High memory usage on the client side.

2. **Virtual Scrolling**:
   - Pros:
     - Efficient rendering of large datasets.
     - Smooth scrolling experience.
   - Cons:
     - More complex implementation.
     - Potential issues with data consistency and user interactions.

## Rationale
jQuery DataTables with AJAX and server-side processing was chosen for the following reasons:
- **Performance**: Efficiently handles large datasets by processing data on the server side, reducing the load on the client.
- **Scalability**: Capable of managing and displaying one million records without performance degradation.
- **Flexibility**: Provides a powerful API for customization and integration with existing backend logic.
- **Community Support**: Well-documented with a strong community, making it easier to find support and examples.

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Improved performance and responsiveness when displaying large datasets.
  - Reduced memory usage on the client side.
  - Enhanced user experience with fast data loading and interaction.
- **Negative**:
  - Additional complexity in implementing server-side processing.
  - Dependency on server-side logic for data retrieval and processing.

## Implementation
The following steps will be taken to implement jQuery DataTables with AJAX and server-side processing in the `ProjectOneMil` project:
1. **Set Up jQuery DataTables**: Include jQuery DataTables via CDN or npm package.
2. **Configure AJAX**: Set up AJAX calls to fetch data from the server.
3. **Implement Server-Side Processing**: Modify the backend to handle data processing and pagination.
4. **Optimize Queries**: Use dynamic LINQ queries to efficiently retrieve and filter data from the database.
5. **Integrate with Frontend**: Ensure seamless integration with the existing frontend components and styling.
